This app is built using SPREAD Studio.

**IMPORTANT**
* When you create (a tagged) release of this Application please do so from your default branch.
* If you do merges outside of Studio (for example, in GitHub) be sure to open the merged default branch once in Studio and push it back to the repository.
    * The `.application/application.json` file only gets created inside of Studio on the default branch and it is needed to bundle the app for distribution.

### Actions Setup

1. **In the repo's Actions configuration page, press "New workflow":**
